    iteration no longer converges all the way to one everywhere on the interval. This

    performance at all relative to UV^T, where USV^T = G is the SVD.

    """Muon - MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-schulz.

    Muon is a generalized steepest descent optimizer using the spectral norm on the
    matrix-valued parameters. This means it always updates in the direction which
    locally reduces the loss as much as possible, while constraining the update to have
    a spectral norm given by the learning rate. It achieves this using a Newton-Schulz
    iteration to orthogonalize the stochastic gradient (or momentum buffer) for each
    matrix in the model before taking a step.

    The spectral norm is an intuitive heuristic because, roughly speaking, it measures
    the maximum change to the activations of a layer that can be caused by a change to
    its weights. By constraining the worst-case change to the activations, we ensure
    that we do not desta

    TThis optimizer is unlikely to work well with small batch sizes, since it strongly
    magnifies small singular values, which will be noisy given a small minibatch.
