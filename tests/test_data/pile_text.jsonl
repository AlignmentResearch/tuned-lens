{"text": "Catalonia election: Puigdemont calls for talks with Spain Published duration 22 December 2017 Related Topics Catalonia independence protests\n\nimage copyright Reuters image caption \"Now is the time for dialogue,\" said Carles Puigdemont\n\nCatalonia's ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, has called for new talks with Spain after separatist parties won a slim majority in a regional election.\n\nHe said he wanted the negotiations in Brussels, where he is living in self-imposed exile, or another EU country.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy later appeared to reject the idea.\n\nHe said he would hold talks with the head of the new Catalan government but that leader would have to take up their post in Catalonia itself.\n\nHe avoided naming Mr Puigdemont, adding that the winner of Thursday's election was In\u00e9s Arrimadas, the leader of the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain.\n\nThe Citizens party is now the region's biggest party. although pro-independence parties are best placed to form a government.\n\n\"Catalonia wants to be an independent state,\" said Mr Puigdemont, speaking in Belgium on Friday. \"This is the wish of the Catalan people. I think the plan of [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy is not working, so we have to find new ways to tackle this crisis.\"\n\nMr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) recorded its worst ever result in Thursday's vote.\n\nHe had hoped that the poll would restore stability and said the Spanish government was \"willing to talk in a realistic way and inside the law\" with a future Catalan government.\n\n\"I offer Catalonia this because we care about the people\" he said.\n\nThe Spanish government imposed direct rule on Catalonia and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal.\n\nMr Puigdemont has also called on the prime minister to repatriate all the police sent to Catalonia before the referendum.\n\nWhat were the results?\n\nWith nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were on course to win a total of 70 seats in total, giving them a majority in the new parliament.\n\nCitizens (Cs) had 25.3% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber.\n\nIts leader told the BBC her party had been \"victorious\". Ms In\u00e9s Arrimadas said forming a coalition would be \"difficult - but we will try\".\n\nThe PP, meanwhile, won only three seats, down from 11 in the previous assembly.\n\nTurnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election.\n\nAnalysis: What the papers say\n\nBy BBC Monitoring\n\nLeading Spanish newspapers say that the result has strengthened the government's position.\n\n\"Nationalism can no longer claim that it exclusively represents Catalonia,\" says Madrid-based La Raz\u00f3n. ABC newspaper thinks Madrid should now settle the Catalan crisis. \"If Spain wants to win this fight in the long term and prevent Catalonia from leaving one day, it should draft a serious plan for strengthening the state.\"\n\nThe result seems to have split Catalan papers between those who want the independence project to continue, and those who accept the realpolitik of the election result.\n\n\"The independence movement has humiliated the Spanish prime minister,\" El Nacional says. \"The decisions that affect Catalonia are not made in Madrid.\"\n\nBut Barcelona's El Peri\u00f3dico says the result means a \"divided Catalonia\". \"The election that Mariano Rajoy called has shown that Catalonia is firmly divided in two blocs and there is hardly any space for intermediaries.\"\n\nLa Vanguardia writes: \"Major forces supporting independence should look back, confess to mistakes and avoid making them again,\"\n\nWhy did the election take place?\n\nSeparatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October after a referendum that was declared illegal by Spain.\n\nIn an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots.\n\nThe move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured.\n\nAccording to referendum organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption In\u00e9s Arrimadas said she would try to form a coalition\n\nHowever, Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain.\n\nMr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election.\n\nProsecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium.\n\nAmong the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nThe European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result.\n\nThe executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain.\n\n\"Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,\" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency.\n\n\"In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,\" he added.\n\nThe Spanish government has not yet commented on the results.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nAnalysts say the success of separatist parties means that the ball is now back in the Spanish government's court.\n\nAntonio Barroso, of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence, says the problem for Madrid remains \"and the secession movement is not going to go away\".\n\nCorrespondents say it is not yet clear whether Mr Puigdemont will be renamed president, and if so, if he will return from Belgium. As things stand, he faces arrest, should he enter Spain.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption Independence supporters celebrated in Barcelona\n\nWhy do many Catalans want independence?\n\nCatalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years.\n\nBefore the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under General Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75.\n\nWhen Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain.\n\nA 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a \"nation\", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010.\n\nRecession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Effect of sleep quality on memory, executive function, and language performance in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and controlled epilepsy versus healthy controls - A prospective study.\nWe aimed to evaluate the effect of sleep quality on memory, executive function, and language performance in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and controlled epilepsy and compare these with healthy individuals. We prospectively enrolled 37 adolescent and adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy (Group 1) and controlled epilepsy (Group 2) in each group. History pertaining to epilepsy and sleep were recorded, and all patients underwent overnight polysomnography. Language, memory, and executive function assessments were done using Western Aphasia Battery, Post Graduate Institute (PGI) memory scale, and battery of four executive function tests (Trail Making Test A & B, Digit symbol test, Stroop Task, and Verbal Fluency Test), respectively. Forty age- and sex-matched controls were also included in the study. Significant differences were noted in both objective and subjective sleep parameters among all the groups. On polysomnography, parameters like total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and rapid eye movement (REM) latency were found to be significantly worse in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. Cognitive and executive parameters were significantly impaired in Group 1. Shorter total sleep time, poorer sleep efficiency, and prolonged sleep latencies were observed to be associated with poor memory and executive function in patients with refractory epilepsy. Our study strongly suggests that sleep disturbances, mainly shorter total sleep time, poor sleep efficiency, and prolonged sleep latencies, are associated with impaired memory and executive function in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and to a lesser extent, among those with medically controlled epilepsy.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Fluorescent labeling of both GABAergic and glycinergic neurons in vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-venus transgenic mouse.\nInhibitory neurons play important roles in a number of brain functions. They are composed of GABAergic neurons and glycinergic neurons, and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) is specifically expressed in these neurons. Since the inhibitory neurons are scattered around in the CNS, it is difficult to identify these cells in living brain preparations. The glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 67-GFP knock-in mouse has been widely used for the identification of GABAergic neurons, but their GAD67 expression was decreased compared to the wild-type mice. To overcome such a problem and to highlight the function and morphology of inhibitory neurons, we generated four lines of VGAT-Venus transgenic mice (lines #04, #29, #39 and #49) expressing Venus fluorescent protein under the control of mouse VGAT promoter. We found higher expression level of Venus transcripts and proteins as well as brighter fluorescent signal in line #39 mouse brains, compared to brains of other lines examined. By Western blots and spectrofluorometric measurements of forebrain, the line #39 mouse showed stronger GFP immunoreactivity and brighter fluorescent intensity than the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse. In addition, Venus was present not only in somata, but also in neurites in the line #39 mouse by histological studies. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the expression pattern of Venus in the line #39 mouse was similar to that of endogenous VGAT. Double immunostaining analysis in line #39 mouse showed that Venus-expressing cells are primarily immunoreactive for GABA in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex and for GABA or glycine in dorsal cochlear nucleus. These results demonstrate that the VGAT-Venus line #39 mouse should be useful for studies on function and morphology of inhibitory neurons in the CNS.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

{"text": "Carotid endarterectomy: operative risks, recurrent stenosis, and long-term stroke rates in a modern series.\nTo determine whether carotid endarterectomy (CEA) safely and effectively maintained a durable reduction in stroke complications over an extended period, we reviewed our data on 478 consecutive patients who underwent 544 CEA's since 1976. Follow-up was complete in 83% of patients (mean 44 months). There were 7 early deaths (1.3%), only 1 stroke related (0.2%). Perioperative stroke rates (overall 2.9%) varied according to operative indications: asymptomatic, 1.4%; transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/amaurosis fugax (AF), 1.3%; nonhemispheric symptoms (NH), 4.9%; and prior stroke (CVA), 7.1%. Five and 10-year stroke-free rates were 96% and 92% in the asymptomatic group, 93% and 87% in the TIA/AF group, 92% and 92% in the NH group, and 80% and 73% in the CVA group. Late ipsilateral strokes occurred infrequently (8 patients, 1.7%). Late deaths were primarily cardiac related (51.3%). Stroke-free rates were significantly (p less than 0.0001) greater than stroke-free survival rates, confirming a non-stroke related cause for late death. Restenoses greater than 50% according to duplex scanning developed in 13%, most (67%) within 2 years after CEA. Most of these (77%) were asymptomatic, and only 0.3% (1 patient) presented with a permanent neurologic deficit. The results of carotid endarterectomy are superior to those of optimal medical management in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in terms of long-term stroke prevention.

{"text": "Early and long-term outcomes after manual and remote magnetic navigation-guided catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia.\nRemote magnetic navigation (RMN) is a safe and effective means of performing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. It may have advantages over manual catheter ablation due to ease of manoeuvrability and catheter stability. We sought to compare the safety and efficacy of RMN vs. manual VT ablation. Retrospective study of procedural outcomes of 139 consecutive VT ablation procedures (69 RMN, 70 manual ablation) in 113 patients between 2009 and 2015 was performed. Remote magnetic navigation was associated with overall higher acute procedural success (80% vs. 60%, P = 0.01), with a trend to fewer major complications (3% vs. 9% P = 0.09). Seventy-nine patients were followed up for a median of 17.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 3.0-41.0] months for the RMN group and 15.5 (IQR 6.5-30.0) months for manual ablation group. In the ischaemic cardiomyopathy subgroup, RMN was associated with longer survival from the composite endpoint of VT recurrence leading to defibrillator shock, re-hospitalization or repeat catheter ablation and all-cause mortality; single-procedure adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.240 (95% CI 0.070-0.821) P = 0.023, multi-procedure HR 0.170 (95% CI 0.046-0.632) P = 0.002. In patients with implanted defibrillators, multi-procedure VT-free survival was superior with RMN, HR 0.199 (95% CI 0.060-0.657) P = 0.003.
