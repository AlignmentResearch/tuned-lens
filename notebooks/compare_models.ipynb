        "# The tuned lens 🔎\n",
        "A tuned lens allows us to peak at the iterative computations that a transformer is using the compute the next token.\n",
        "\n",
        "A lens into a transformer with n layers allows you to replace the last $m$ layers of the model with an [affine transformation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) (we call these affine translators).\n",
        "\n",
        "This essentially skips over these last few layers and lets you see the best prediction that can be made from the model's representations, i.e. the residual stream, at layer $n - m$. Since the representations may be rotated, shifted, or stretched from layer to layer it's useful to train the len's affine translators specifically on each layer. This training is what differentiates this method from simpler approaches that decode the residual stream of the network directly using the unembeding layer i.e. the logit lens. We explain this process along with more applications of the method in [the paper](ttps://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112).\n",
        "\n",
        "You can find the complete set of pretrained lenses on [the hugging face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens/tree/main/lens).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "Since the tuned lens produces a distribution of predictions to visualize it's output we need to we need to provide a summary statistic to plot.  The default is simply [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), but you can also choose the [cross entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) with the target token, or the [KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the model's predictions and the tuned lens' predictions. You can also hover over a token to see more of the distribution i.e. the top 10 most probable tokens and their probabilities.\n",
